The XML (Extensible Markup Language) TISS (Supplementary Health Information Exchange) Editor is a system designed to facilitate modifications specifically in .xml files.

Built purely with HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language), CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets), and vanilla JavaScript, it decodes the XML and transforms it into an object for extracting information. The system also features a user-friendly and simple interface for easy understanding.
